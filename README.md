# firstListen

I'm a big fan of NPR's [First Listen](http://www.npr.org/series/98679384/first-listen) series, but I really dislike their pop-up music player. For a few weeks, I would paste their embed codes into a blank html file and just use that to keep up with the albums I was interetsed in. 

A few albums later, I realized this would make a great small-scale front-end project...
